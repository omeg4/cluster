NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect one of the following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too small.

NIntegrate::eincr: The global error of the strategy GlobalAdaptive has increased more than 2000 times. The global error is expected to decrease monotonically after a number of integrand evaluations. Suspect one of the following: the working precision is insufficient for the specified precision goal; the integrand is highly oscillatory or it is not a (piecewise) smooth function; or the true value of the integral is 0. Increasing the value of the GlobalAdaptive option MaxErrorIncreases might lead to a convergent numerical integration. NIntegrate obtained 161.481433154500631825447617720831691149618954398949943350346869747130561043026016566285703164686652487986340204117384672305750328879405239589300978519 and 0.0000517170943189077983837669822419591082407618415236607656064858491275890119805445164894385085287661750860979226219123470410463721252809084074685246491401 for the integral and error estimates.
